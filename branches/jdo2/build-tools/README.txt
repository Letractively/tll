This module is multi-faceted:

1. Creates tll-assemblies.jar containing assemblies for use by all tll module projects.

2. Contains shell scripts for installing tll dependencies into the local maven repo that
   are invoked by referencing them relative to the current tll module.  
   These scripts are *not* installed to the local repo.
   
3. misc resources for build related tasks that are *not* installed to the local maven repo.
